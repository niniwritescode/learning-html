    <p>While his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success soared in 2007 with four consecutive
        box-office hits; it was consistent until a short period of decline between 2009 and 2011, after which he
        reinforced his status with several films, including Rowdy Rathore (2012) and Holiday (2014). Moreover, around
        this time critical response to several of his films improved; his work in Special 26 (2013), Baby (2015),
        Airlift (2016), and Jolly LLB 2 (2017) was acclaimed, and he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the
        crime thriller Rustom (2016). He earned further notice for his self-produced social films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha
        (2017) and Pad Man (2018), as well as the war film Kesari (2019), and set box-office records in 2019 with
        Kesari, Mission Mangal, Housefull 4, Good Newwz, and the 2021 action film Sooryavanshi. All of Kumar's
        subsequent theatrical releases failed commercially, with the exception of the comedy-drama OMG 2 (2023).[12]</p>
