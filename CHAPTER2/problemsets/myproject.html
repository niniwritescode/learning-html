    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The ancient Sanskrit name of the city, वृन्दावन (Vṛndāvana), comes from its groves of vṛndā (holy basil) and vana
        (grove, forest).[3]</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Vrindavan has an ancient past, associated with Hindu culture and history, and was established in the 16th and
        17th centuries as a result of an explicit treaty between Muslims and Hindu Emperors,[11] and is an important
        Hindu pilgrimage site since long</p>
    <p>In contemporary times,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallabha"> Vallabha Charya</a> (an Indian saint from
        15th century), aged eleven visited Vrindavan. Later
        on, he performed three pilgrimages of India, barefoot giving discourses on <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita">Bhagvad Gita</a> at 84 places. These 84
        places are known as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushtimarg_Baithak">Pushtimarg Baithak</a> and since
        then have the places of pilgrimage. Yet, he stayed in Vrindavan
        for four months each year. Vrindavan thus heavily influenced his formation of Pushtimarg.</p>
    <p>The essence of Vrindavan was lost over time until the 16th century when it was rediscovered by Chaitanya
        Mahaprabhu. In the year 1515,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitanya_Mahaprabhu">Chaitanya
            Mahaprabhu</a> visited Vrindavan, with the purpose of locating the lost
        holy places associated with Krishna's life.[12]</p>

    <p>In the last 250 years, the extensive forests of Vrindavan have been subjected to urbanisation, first by
        local Rajas and in recent decades by apartment developers. The forest cover has been whittled away to only a
        fewremaining spots, and the local wildlife, including peacocks, cows, monkeys and a variety of bird species
        has been virtually eliminated.</p>

    <h3>Banke Bihari Temple</h3>
    <p>Banke Bihari Temple is a Hindu temple situated in the town of Vrindavan, Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh,
        India. The temple is dedicated to Banke Bihari who is believed to be the combined form of Radha and Krishna.
        Banke Bihari was originally worshipped at Nidhivan, Vrindavan. Later, when Banke Bihari temple was constructed
        around 1864, the icon of Banke Bihari was moved to its present temple.[2][3]</p>

        height="400" />
    <p>In Banke Bihari temple, the icon of Radha Krishna's united form stands in the Tribhanga posture. Swami Haridas
        originally worshipped this murti under the name of <b><i>Kunj Bihari</i></b> which means the one who enjoys in
        the groves or Kunj of Vrindavan.[4]</p>

        alt="Banke Bihari Temple Inside View" height="500" />
    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>The icon of Banke Bihari was originally worshiped by Svāmī Haridās under the name Kuñjbihārī. His disciples
        bestowed the name Bānke Bihārī due to the image's tribhaṅga posture. The icon's appearance is celebrated on
        Bihar Panchami. Formerly Bānke Bihārī was worshipped in Nidhivan, but was moved to the present location in the
        19th century due a dispute between the sādhu and gosvāmī followers of Haridās. The gosvāmī's built the current
        temple and reside behind it.[5]</p>

    <h5>Scriptures</h5>
    <p>'Bānke' means 'bent', and 'Bihāri' or 'Vihāri' means 'enjoyer'. This is how Kṛiṣhṇa, who is bent in three places,
        got the name "Bānke Bihāri". According to Śrī Brahma-saḿhitā (verse 5.31), Brahma says the following about
        Kṛishna

        "I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, round whose neck is swinging a garland of flowers beautified with the
        moon-locket, whose two hands are adorned with the flute and jewelled ornaments, who always revels in pastimes of
        love, whose graceful threefold-bending form of Śyāmasundara is eternally manifest."[6][7]</p>

    <h3>Nidhivan</h3>
    <p>Nidhivan (Hindi: निधिवन), (meaning, Sacred Forest) is one of the sacred sites of Vrindavan, situated in the
        Mathura district, Uttar Pradesh, India.[1] It is considered as the most prominent site dedicated to the pastimes
        of the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna and their cowherd companions, the Gopikas. It is a common belief among
        devotees that Nidhivan still witnesses the rasa-lila (dance) of Radha and Krishna during the night and thus, to
        protect the forest's sanctity, Nidhivan is closed with barricades during the night.[2]</p>

        alt="Radharani Nidhivan" />
    <p>The forest has numerous Tulasi trees which are short in height, but are found in pairs and have entangled trunks.
        Besides the Tulasi plants, the premises also houses a temple called Rang Mahal, where it is believed that Radha
        and Krishna spend their night after the exhausting dance. Within the premises, there is also another temple
        called <i><b>Sri Bansichori Radharani Temple</b></i>, a shrine dedicated to Swami Haridas who created the Banke
        Bihari idol,
        Raslila Sthali where the dance is performed and the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalita_(gopi)">Lalita
            Pond</a> which was believed to be made by Krishna
        himself, when the cowherds asked for water amidst of their tiring dance.[3][4][5]</p>

        height="400" />
    <h5>Rang Mahal</h5>
    <p>Rang Mahal, meaning Colourful Palace, is another temple in Nidhivan, known as the place where Radha was dressed
        up by Krishna. It is believed, that every night, Radha and Krishna themselves come to this palace to relax after
        their exhausting dance. The temple has sandalwood beds for sleeping. Every evening, before closing the temple
        gates, the temple priests make the bed, place ornaments like bangles, flowers and clothes for Radha, Tulasi
        leaves, Neem twigs to be used as toothbrushes, sweets and betel nuts and leaves to eat, and a jar full of water
        beside the bed. After all the arrangements are made by the priests, the main doors of the Rang Mahal and
        Nidhivan are locked from the outside and unlocked only in the morning. But every morning, they find that the bed
        looks as if someone has slept on it, the Neem twigs look used and the sweets and betel leaves look like they
        were partially eaten by someone. Also, the bangles, flowers and clothes look used, disordered and
        disarranged.[2][3v</p>

    <p>[Prem Mandir UP] (lit. The Temple of Divine Love) is a Hindu temple in Vrindavan, Mathura district, Western Uttar
        Pradesh, India. The temple was established by Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj.[1] It is maintained by

        Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj. Their idols are placed alongside the rasik saints of Braj, making Prem Mandir
        one of the rare temples to honour all five Jagadgurus in one place.</p>

    <p>Sri Radha Raman Temple, is a Hindu temple situated in Vrindavan, India. It is dedicated to Krishna who is
        worshiped as Radha Ramana. This temple is counted as one of the Seven most revered ancient temples of Vrindavan
        along with Radha Vallabh Temple, Radha Damodar Temple, Radha Madanmohan Temple, Radha Govindji Temple, Radha
        Shyamsundar Temple and Radha Gokulnandan Temple. The temple houses the original<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaligram">Shaligram</a> deity of Krishna
        alongside goddess Radha.[1][2]</p>
    <p>Radha Raman means the lover (ramana) of Sri Radha. The temple was established over 500 years ago by Gopala Bhatta
        Goswami.[3] At the age of thirty, Gopala Bhatta Gosvami came to Vrindavana. After Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's
        disappearance, Gopala Bhatta Gosvami felt intense separation from the Lord. To relieve his devotee from the
        pangs of separation, the Lord instructed Gopala Bhatta in a dream "If you want My Darshan then make a trip to
        Nepal".

        In Nepal, Gopala Bhatta bathed in the famous Kali-Gandaki River. Upon dipping his waterpot in the river, he was
        surprised to see several Shaligrama Shilas enter his pot. He dropped the Shilas back into the river, but the
        Shilas re-entered his pot when he refilled it.</p>
